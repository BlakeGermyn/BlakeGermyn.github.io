# Portfolio Website - Project One
This Website was created as a requirement of project one, within The Learning People's code+ course.
The purpose of the website is to provide a platform to which others can view about me/ my work, utilizing a streamline and minimalist interface for ease of use. Within the website, the ability to learn about me, contact me, and navigate to a "notional" portfolio page to which will in the future contain all projects i have completed are present.

  # Testings
Testing was done on the responsiveness of the website layout across the three main screen sizes used, utilizing a chrome "Width and Height" extension to test different resolutions. 
## Findings
My findings were that there were breakpoints within the website that were remedied using alternative interface design. Examples include The navigation bar for desktops being replaced by a hamburger menu for mobiles and tablets.
